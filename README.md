Rust implementation of TEA cipher

Compatible with [RustCrypto: Block Cipher Traits](https://github.com/RustCrypto/traits/tree/master/block-cipher).

## Warnings
TEA is not a particularly secure cipher, let alone the implementation makes no effort on avoiding side-channel attack.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## Usage
